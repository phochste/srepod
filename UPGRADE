Follow these steps to upgrade a srepod installation.

+ Stop the daemon

    $ cd /opt/srepod-2-X-X/bin
    $ ./daemonctl stop

+ Install the new version of srepod

    $ cd /tmp
    $ gunzip -c srepod-2-X-Y.tar.gz | tar xvf -

    + Optionally edit the src/Makefile to change the INSTDIR (use absolute path, INSTDIR should *not* be the directory where you unpacked the software package)

    $ cd src

    (The following command may need root privileges)

    # make
    # make install

    + Edit the configuration of your web server. Add a 'gateway' symbolic link 
    from your cgi-bin directory to the cgi-bin directory of this package. 
    Add a gateway' symbolic link from your htdocs directory to the htdocs 
    directory of this package. E.g.

        $ cd /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin
        $ ln -s /opt/srepod-2-X-X/cgi-bin gateway
        $ cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs
        $ ln -s /opt/srepod-2-X-X/htdocs gateway

    + Edit cgi-bin/environ:
		
	  ** set the correct GWBASEURL and GWREGISTRY URL's and GWHOME path.
	  ** set a correct GWADMIN email address
	  ** set the GWVALIDBASEURL=0 to test your installation, set the
	     GWVALIDBASEURL=1 in production mode

    + Edit the files ${GWHOME}/htdocs/registry.html and ${GWHOME}/htdocs/terminator.html
    to reflect the right location of the gateway CGI scripts.

    + Copy the gateway.conf file from the previous version to the new
    version. E.g.:

        cp /opt/srepod-2-1-1/cgi-bin/gateway.conf /opt/srepod-2-1-2/cgi-bin

    (You can keep the previous version on disk, or also copy the 
    complete db directory to the new version and edit the paths in the
    gateway.conf file)

    + Run "sh chmod.sh" as root. Set here the user and group name that 
    will run cgi scripts. This is normally the 'nobody' user and 'nobody' 
    group.

    + Start the daemon:

        $ cd /opt/srepod-2-X-X/bin
	    $ su
	    # ./deamonctl start
