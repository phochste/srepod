<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     curl_multi_perform - add an easy handle to a multi session


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

     CURLMcode  curl_multi_perform(CURLM *multi_handle, int *run­
     ning_handles);


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     When  the  app  thinks  there's  data  available   for   the
     multi_handle,  it  should  call  this function to read/write
     whatever  there   is   to   read   or   write   right   now.
     curl_multi_perform() returns as soon as the reads/writes are
     done. This function does not require that there actually  is
     any  data available for reading or that data can be written,
     it can be called just in case. It will write the  number  of
     handles  that  still  transfer data in the second argument's
     integer-pointer.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     CURLMcode type, general libcurl multi interface error  code.

     NOTE  that  this only returns errors etc regarding the whole
     multi stack. There might still  have  occurred  problems  on
     invidual transfers even when this function returns OK.


</PRE>
<H2>TYPICAL USAGE</H2><PRE>
     Most  application  will  use  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>multi</I><B>_</B><I>fdset</I>  to  get  the
     multi_handle's file descriptors, then it'll wait for  action
     on  them  using  select() and as soon as one or more of them
     are ready, <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>multi</I><B>_</B><I>perform</I> gets called.
